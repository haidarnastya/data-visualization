# Data Visualization Graduate Projects
This repository contains projects and assignments from my graduate course DSCI 554: Data Visualization at USC.  
The projects explore a variety of visualization tools and techniques using R, Python, D3.js, and HTML, including both static and interactive visualizations.

## Current Projects
The repository currently includes the following projects:

1. **UN Data Visual Display with D3 and Google Charts**
   - Designed and built a visual display using HTML to explore UN population data, following concepts from *The Functional Art* by Alberto Cairo.
   - Selected two UN datasets:
     - Population proportion over 60 years old
     - Crude birth rate
   - Visualizations implemented using:
     - **D3.js** – custom interactive charts
     - **Google Charts** – integrated charts 
   - Used Generative AI (ChatGPT) to assist with design, customization, and implementation of the visual display.

2. **Global Precipitation Data Visualization**
   - Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on UN precipitation data to explore annual precipitation trends across countries.
   - The dataset includes country names, year, and precipitation amounts (in million cubic meters).
   - Visualizations were created using:
     - **R (ggplot2)** – initial EDA exploring the distribution of precipitation values across countries.
     - **Python (Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas)** – further EDA including correlations, time trends, and multivariate relationships.
   - Analysis considered:
     - Understanding the data context and structure
     - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for visualization
     - Descriptive statistics and summary tables
     - Exploring correlations and relationships between countries and years
     - Time series trends and potential patterns
     - Handling data imbalances
     - Regression modeling and hypothesis testing
   - Interactive visualizations were implemented in Altair to explore precipitation trends dynamically.

> More projects will be added here as the course progresses.
